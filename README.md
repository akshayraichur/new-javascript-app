## New Javascript App

> Hello folks, I am creating this package which will help devs to kickstart their vanilla-js app quickly. This is still in development (WIP) stage. Connect with me for more ideas.

### Installation

`npx new-javascript-app <app-name>`
You need to give the app name, else the project wont be created.
